## NASA-Meteorites-Analyses

I was interested in exploring Meteorite Landings Data from NASA, Data.Gov. to examine how many meteorites were landed on earth.

# Research Questions to Answer:
1) How many meteorites were found? 
2) Which meteorites were found in the earliest year?
3) What sizes of meteorites were found so far? 
4) Where were the largest meteoritesâ€™ landing spots?
5) What types of meteorites did we find?
6) Which countries found more meteorites?

# Materials & Methods
I obtained the csv file from Data.gov.
I used: python - pandas (data manipulation), citipy (for obtaining city and country names to match with geo locations), and matplotlib and gmap (for visualization).
