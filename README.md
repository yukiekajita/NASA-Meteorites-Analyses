## NASA-Meteorites-Analyses

I was interested in exploring Meteorite Landings Data from NASA, Data.Gov. to examine how many meteorites were landed on earth.

### Research Questions to Answer:
1) How many meteorites were found? 
2) Which meteorites were found in the earliest year?
3) What sizes of meteorites were found so far? 
4) Where were the largest meteoritesâ€™ landing spots?
5) What types of meteorites did we find?
6) Which countries found more meteorites?

### Materials & Methods
1) I obtained the csv file from Data.gov - the total rows were 45,716. The last update was conducted on July 17, 2020.
2) I used: python - pandas (data manipulation), citipy (for obtaining city and country names to match with geo locations), and matplotlib and gmap (for visualization).
3) Data manipulation: I removed date and time from a column of 'year' by splitting the column information. I obtained city and country names for each data row using 'citipy' by using GeoLocation.

### Results
1) How many meteorites were found? - There were 706, 24,004, and 13,404 meteorites discovered on earth < 1900, 1900-2000, and 2000-current year, respectively.

* I set up bins to create a range of years to show the total number of meteorites for each year range.

2) Which meteorites were found in the earliest year? - The oldest meteorite found on earth was Nogata city in Japan in 860.
